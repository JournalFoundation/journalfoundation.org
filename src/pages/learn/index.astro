      <h2>Why Privacy Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Surveillance capitalism treats attention and behavior as raw material. Platforms harvest every click,
        pause, and scroll to predict and influence what you will do next. Even when content is encrypted, the
        surrounding metadata powers algorithmic manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sovereignty means choosing who sees your life. It means preventing bulk data seizure, resisting
        behavioral profiling, and keeping human agency at the center of every digital interaction.

      <h2>Essential Concepts</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>What is Metadata?</h3>
        <p>
          Metadata is "data about data." It includes who you talk to, when messages are sent, how large files
          are, and where requests originate. It can reveal habits, relationships, and sensitive routines—even if
          the message contents are encrypted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: A 2 a.m. call from the same location every night says more about your life than the words
          exchanged. Metadata fuels ad targeting, insurance decisions, and even political intimidation.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>What is End-to-End Encryption?</h3>
        <p>
          End-to-end encryption (E2EE) means only the sender and intended recipient can read message contents.
          Apps like Signal and WhatsApp use E2EE so service providers cannot decrypt your texts.
        </p>
        <p>
          But encryption alone doesn't hide <em>who</em> is talking, <em>when</em>, or <em>how often</em>. Those
          metadata trails are often more revealing than the words themselves.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>What is Decentralization?</h3>
        <p>
          Decentralization distributes infrastructure across many operators, like Mastodon or the broader
          Fediverse. It removes single points of failure and corporate control.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, decentralization without anonymization leaves metadata exposed. Instance admins or network
          observers can still map social graphs, download encrypted blobs, and correlate identities.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>What is Anonymization?</h3>
        <p>
          Anonymization limits the metadata that can be collected in the first place. Techniques like capability
          tokens, blind relays, traffic padding, and selective exfiltration make it difficult to track who is
          communicating or what they're accessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without anonymization, decentralization becomes surveillance with extra steps. The Journal Protocol
          Stack is designed to solve both.

      <h2>Advanced Topics</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Understanding Threat Models</h3>
        <p>
          A threat model is a structured way to ask: who could harm me, what do they want, and what resources do
          they control? Answering those questions tells you which protections matter most.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>The China Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Bulk data seizure paired with future decryption power is a real risk. Nation-states can collect
          encrypted content today, store it indefinitely, and wait for quantum breakthroughs. The stack counters
          this with selective exfiltration, rapid key rotation, and compartmentalized access.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Why "I have nothing to hide" is wrong</h3>
        <p>
          Privacy isn't about secrecy. It's about power. When only governments and corporations control data,
          they control narratives, markets, and democratic processes. Privacy preserves the ability to dissent,
          to explore new ideas, and to be fully human.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>How Influence Works at Scale</h3>
        <p>
          Influence campaigns combine metadata analysis, behavioral nudging, and algorithmic amplification. They
          don't need to read your messages to shape your worldview—they just need to know when to push, pull, or
          distract. Learning how these systems operate helps you build communities that resist them.
