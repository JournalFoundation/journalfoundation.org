# Terms of Use

_These Terms govern your access to and use of websites at **journalfoundation.org** and any services we link to these Terms (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services, you agree to these Terms._

## 1. <a id="acceptance"></a>Acceptance & Scope
You must be able to form a binding contract to use the Services. If you access on behalf of an organization, you represent that you’re authorized to accept these Terms for it. Certain features may have additional terms; if they conflict, the feature-specific terms control.

> **Implementation note:** We obtain affirmative consent where it matters (e.g., submit buttons labeled “By submitting, you agree to the Terms”, checkboxes on account forms) to avoid “browsewrap” pitfalls seen in U.S. cases requiring conspicuous notice and assent. See our Legal FAQ for details.

## 2. <a id="changes"></a>Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms. When we do, we’ll update the “Last updated” date and post a site banner for material changes. Continued use after the effective date means you accept the changes.

## 3. <a id="acceptable-use"></a>Acceptable Use
Do not misuse the Services. Prohibited behavior includes: unlawful activity; spam or automated abuse; interfering with normal operations; attempting to access non-public systems; and infringing others’ rights. Good-faith **security research** is welcome—please follow our [Security / Responsible Disclosure](/security).
