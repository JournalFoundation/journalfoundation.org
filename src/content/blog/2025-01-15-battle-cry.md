I get emotional when I repeat the promise that keeps me building.

**Privacy. Security. Sovereignty.**

The world we rely on is being reshaped by Google, Facebook, TikTok, Uber. Not just nudged—**reshaped**. And I believe we can guide that change toward something healthier.

## The Boa Constrictor

Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk wield outsized influence over how we connect and communicate. It can feel suffocating when platforms as large as Facebook, X, Amazon, and Google dictate the defaults for the rest of us.

We deserve room to breathe.

All of our screens, all of the time, are giving us algorithmic manipulation. The top 10 on Netflix. The movies at theaters. The news feeds. Even the music I listen to. It's called the monoculture.

## When Robots Come

Right now it's a screen next to us. But soon it's a smiling face—your best friend—and every 10th sentence is an advertisement.

Predictive interfaces are already here, and more personable assistants are coming fast.

If we don't create open, humane alternatives—tools that belong to the people who use them—we risk narrowing the space for independent thought and diverse communities.

We can build a brighter digital future.

## The Solution

When individuals have privacy, when they have data security, when they control their data—corporations no longer dictate the terms because they don't hold every insight about us.

We can understand ourselves. Not some simulacrum Facebook assembles. Not a profile curated by an algorithm. But who we are, on our own terms.

**That is my battle cry.**
## What Journal Foundation Does

We're not building apps. We're building the **infrastructure** that lets developers build apps without platforms.

Three layers:
1. **Vault** - encrypted storage
2. **Cipherlot** - capability-based sharing
3. **Apps** - built by independent developers
