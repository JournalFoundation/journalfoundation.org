I get emotional when I repeat my battle cry. It's a hill for me to die on.

**Privacy. Security. Sovereignty.**

The world is being destroyed by Google, Facebook, TikTok, Uber. Not just harmed—**destroyed**. And I think I can save the goddamn world.

## The Boa Constrictor

Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have their clutches in us collectively as Americans and humans. We're down bleeding on the mat as these two behemoths—Facebook and Twitter and Amazon and Google—tighten and tighten the screws.

We're not breathing. We're just getting squeezed.

All of our screens, all of the time, are giving us algorithmic manipulation. The top 10 on Netflix. The movies at theaters. The news feeds. Even the music I listen to. It's called the monoculture.

## When Robots Come

Right now it's a screen next to us. But soon it's a smiling face—your best friend—and every 10th sentence is an advertisement.

The hypnotism by robots is coming, whether I do it or not.

If I don't create this slippery, swirly, free, radical way for us to have OUR robots—our FREE robots—then it's lights out for human free thought and diversity.

It's a new dark ages.

## The Solution

When individuals have privacy, when they have data security, when they control their data—corporations can't touch us because they don't know us.

We can know ourselves. Not some simulacrum Facebook thinks we are. Not who Facebook presents to us people are. But who we actually are, on our own terms.

**That is my battle cry.**
## What Journal Foundation Does

We're not building apps. We're building the **infrastructure** that lets developers build apps without platforms.

Three layers:
1. **Vault** - encrypted storage
2. **Cypherlot** - capability-based sharing
3. **Apps** - built by independent developers
