In this first episode, I sit down to explain the core problem we're solving: algorithmic manipulation and surveillance capitalism have their clutches in us, and we need infrastructure for sovereignty—not another platform.

## Topics Covered

- The boa constrictor metaphor: how big tech is tightening its grip
- Why Mastodon and Diaspora failed (platforms vs protocols)
- What makes Cypherlots different: encryption, capabilities, metadata minimization
- The puppet paradigm: ethical puppet masters vs corporate control
- What's next for the foundation

## Key Quotes

> "Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have their clutches in us collectively as Americans and humans. We're down bleeding on the mat as these two behemoths tighten and tighten the screws."

> "Your data in your basement, not Zuckerberg's data center. That's the whole point."

> "If we don't create this free, radical way for humans to have THEIR OWN robots—then it's lights out for human free thought and diversity."
