## Goal

By the end of this tutorial you will have a local Vault and client exchanging encrypted messages using the core Cipherlot protocol.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Docker 24+
- Git

## Steps

1. **Clone the quickstart repo.**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/journalfoundation/vault-quickstart.git
   cd vault-quickstart
   ```
2. **Start the Vault container.**
   ```bash
   docker compose up vault
   ```
3. **Install client dependencies.**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Send a test message.** Follow the prompts in your terminal to create a capability token and exchange a message.

## Next steps
