Cipherlots assume a world where metadata surveillance is the default. Implementers must understand who we defend against and where the limits lie.

## Primary adversaries

- **Platform operators:** Services that monetize behavioral data.
- **Network observers:** Entities capable of bulk packet capture and correlation.
- **Co-located tenants:** Malicious services attempting to exfiltrate colocated data.

## Non-goals

- Compromised user devices.
- Coercion that extracts secrets directly from humans.
- Nation-state regulation compelling plaintext logging.

## Design responses

- Use of OHTTP relays to blind request metadata.
- Capability tokens for least-privilege access.
- Vault-to-client ratchets for forward secrecy.
