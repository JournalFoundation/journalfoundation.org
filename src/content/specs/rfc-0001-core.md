## Status of This Memo

This document is a Draft RFC and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time.

## Abstract

A Cypherlot is a personal, encrypted data node that enables sovereignty over digital information through capability-based sharing and metadata minimization. This specification defines the core protocol requirements.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

**Decentralization alone is insufficient for digital sovereignty.**

Existing decentralized systems (Mastodon, Diaspora, ActivityPub) solve the centralization problem but create new vulnerabilities:

- **Metadata exposure:** Federation protocols reveal who talks to whom
- **Instance admin surveillance:** Server operators see all user activity  
- **Traffic correlation:** Network observers can build social graphs
- **Bulk seizure:** Encrypted data can be downloaded and stored for future decryption
- **Quantum threat:** Post-quantum computers will retroactively decrypt today's traffic

**Cypherlots provides anonymization, not just decentralization:**

- **Metadata minimization:** Blind relays that can't see message contents or routing
- **Traffic obfuscation:** OHTTP prevents correlation of communication patterns
- **Selective disclosure:** Capability-based sharing prevents bulk data exfiltration
- **Forward secrecy:** Cryptographic ratcheting makes old data unrecoverable
- **No identity registry:** Decentralized capabilities eliminate central correlation points

### 1.2 Threat Model

Cypherlots defends against:

1. **Platform surveillance** (Facebook, Google model)
2. **Federation surveillance** (Mastodon admin model)  
3. **Metadata correlation** (NSA bulk collection model)
4. **Bulk seizure + quantum decryption** (China problem)
5. **Traffic analysis** (Tor adversary model)

Cypherlots does NOT defend against:

- Compromised end-user devices
- Physical coercion with key disclosure
- Real-time MITM if user accepts bad certificates
- Social engineering attacks

### 1.3 Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components

A Cypherlot consists of:

- **Vault**: Encrypted storage backend
- **Capability Manager**: Grant/revoke access tokens
- **Discovery Service**: Optional mesh networking
- **Relay**: Optional metadata-blind proxy

### 2.2 Encryption Requirements

All data MUST be encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM or equivalent. Encryption keys MUST be derived from user-controlled secrets.

## 3. Capability-Based Sharing

### 3.1 Capability Tokens

Access grants are represented as capability tokens that encode:

- Resource identifier
- Scope (read, write, admin)
- Expiration time
- Revocation nonce

### 3.2 Token Format

```
capability := HMAC-SHA256(secret, scope || resource || exp || nonce)
```

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 Threat Model

Cypherlots defend against:

- Platform surveillance
- Metadata correlation
- Third-party tracking
- Coerced disclosure (via plausible deniability)

### 4.2 Limitations

Cypherlots do NOT protect against:

- Compromised client devices
- Physical coercion with key disclosure
- Traffic analysis at network layer (without relay)
